severity_of_accidents_on_highways is a repository dedicated to a project developed using python programming language under the context of University of Porto Master's Degree in Civil Engineering. 

The project consisted of the treatment and processing of a dataset of accidents that occurred on a Portuguese highway under management of a Portuguese Company specialized in the operation and maintenance of road infraestructures, from 2017 to 2022. In order to determine the factors that impact the most on the severity of the accidents that occured on the addressed highways, an Ordered Probability Model was implemented on the Google Collab environment, using Python programming language and applying Pandas framework.
